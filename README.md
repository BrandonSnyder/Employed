##Description
This application will allow professionals looking for a job connect with companies looking to fill a qualified employee. 

User Story
AS A an unemployed professional who is searching for a job
I WANT to see companies hiring in my area or a selected area 
SO THAT I can network with recruiters and ultimately get hired
In the future, hope to implement a swipe feature that will allow a user to just swipe let or right if they feel that he/she will be a good match.
